# first-public-repo

This is the first public repository in this organization.

## Purpose

This repository was created for importing the GitHub organization into Guardrails for management. 

### Why This Repo Exists

- We need both a **Public** and **Private** repository to properly test and verify that credentials are working correctly
- This public repository serves as a test case to ensure the integration setup is functioning as expected
